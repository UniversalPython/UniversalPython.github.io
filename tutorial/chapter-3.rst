Your First Program
==================

Programming may seem intimidating at first, but it really starts with just a few words and one good idea.

In this tutorial, you’ll write your first real Python program using UniversalPython. You’ll use familiar, everyday language to tell the computer what to do.

You don’t need to understand everything right away. Just follow the steps and see what happens!

.. important::

    If you haven’t set up UniversalPython yet, go to the Setup section first, then come back here when you're ready.

**1. Create the File**

Open your text editor and create a new file.

If you're using French, save the file as: ``main.fr.py``

The file extension (like ``.fr.py``) tells UniversalPython which language you're writing in. (In this case, French)
