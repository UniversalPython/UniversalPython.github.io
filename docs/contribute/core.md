# Improving UniversalPython

There are tonnes of interesting challenges which, when solved, can make UniversalPython easier to use and more resilient:
- [ ] In-transpiler translation of sentences (e.g. translating strings)
- [ ] How can we manage imports of packages, and the functions inside of them?
- [ ] Supporting new and old versions of Python

Feel free to share more challenges in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/UniversalPython/UniversalPython/discussions). We're ready for impact.
