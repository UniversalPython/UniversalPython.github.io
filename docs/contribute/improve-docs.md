# Improving the docs

We maintain our docs on GitHub, using Docusaurus. Some important tasks which are pending:
- [ ] Translation of the documentation to different languages
- [ ] Making it easier for people to suggest new words and add them to the dictionary
- [ ] Computer science education, via a YouTube channel or blogs, in Native languages

Feel free to share more tasks in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/UniversalPython/UniversalPython/discussions). We're ready for impact.
