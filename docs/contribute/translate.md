# Translate into your language

Are you a native speaker of a language and can contribute to making UniversalPython's keywords more accurate? Or want to add an entirely new language to UniversalPython? Look no further. 

The list of languages supported are visible [here](https://github.com/UniversalPython/UniversalPython/tree/%D9%85%D8%B1%DA%A9%D8%B2/urdupython/languages).

Our translations are (currently) managed in the form of [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files, like [this one right here](https://github.com/UniversalPython/UniversalPython/blob/%D9%85%D8%B1%DA%A9%D8%B2/urdupython/languages/hi/hi_native.lang.yaml). Simply make one for your own language, and share it with us by opening a Pull Request on GitHub, or simply sharing it with us on email at info@grayhat.com.pk
