# Welcome

Welcome to the UniversalPython documentation! Learn more about UniversalPython, the motivation behind it, and how it works.

## Our vision

We know how hard it is to know multiple languages and get started with computer science and programming. Almost all the material you search for, all the books, videos, and even all of the major programming languages of world, are in English. Did you know that only 27% of the entire world's population knows English? How does the rest of the world learn? This is something we have yet to understand.

## History

UniversalPython started off as UrduPython; the idea of a young student in NUCES, Islamabad, Pakistan. The motivation is simple; programming languages have a basic syntax comprising of "keywords". If there was a basic mapping of those keywords into other languages, the people of Pakistan (a country of **77 established languages**) could learn programming much better. 

## Progress

We went public with UniversalPython in March, 2023. We're looking for amazing maintainers and contributers, and wish to initiate a movement across the world to make programming languages and computer science education accessible to all.
