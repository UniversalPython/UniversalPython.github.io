    This tutorial introduces you to UniversalPython, a tool that helps learners write Python code using keywords and identifiers in their native human language.


This tutorial introduces you to **UniversalPython**, a tool that helps learners write Python code using keywords and identifiers in their **native human language**.

UniversalPython is **not a new language**. It is a **transpiler**, a small layer that translates code written in other natural languages into standard Python. This allows students to begin learning Python concepts using familiar vocabulary.

All code written in UniversalPython is executed as **real Python**. You can use the full Python standard library and any third-party packages. The goal of UniversalPython is to **lower the language barrier**, not to replace or redefine Python.

This tutorial is written for:

- Learners who want to explore Python in their own language
- Teachers who want to introduce programming without the barrier of English syntax

To follow this tutorial, you will need:

- Python 3.4 or later
- A Terminal or Jupiter Notebook
- Optionally, access to the `Online Playground <https://universalpython.github.io/playground/>`_ for running code in the browser

We recommend reading the tutorial chapters in order. However, if you are already familiar with Python and only want to understand UniversalPythonâ€™s features, you may skip ahead to the Using Your Native Language in Python chapter.
